[French version](LISEZMOI.md)

## Summary

This is the nuget source code of the Distributor API.<br><br> As a partner of Sherweb, you are considered as a Distributor when you buy products and services directly from a Supplier, Sherweb for instance, and you sell them to your Customers (and/or to others resellers). Thus, for a specific billing period, as a distributor you need to know what you owe to Sherweb. To do so, you can use de Distibutor API.
