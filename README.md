## Nugets source code

We have an organization on nuget.org: (https://www.nuget.org/profiles/Sherweb). All public nugets are there. This repository provides all the source code of these nugets if you want to build it on your own instead of using the nuget. Each folder is an API and there is a readme for each API to help you using it. To build the code, you gonna need to open the .sln file in Visual Studio.

## Sample code

In the folder Sherweb.SampleCode, you can find all examples on how to use the nugets. All examples are made in c#. This is where the clientId, client secret and subscription key are gonna be use. Feel free to submit us any code enhancement.
